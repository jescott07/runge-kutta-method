# Runge-Kutta method

In this repository I will show how to use Runge-Kutta and other methods to solve differential equations.

$\huge{Introduction}$

In a simple equation we have a equality that relates one variable to others, so we can draw a function ho tells how this variable chages in relation to others variables. A diferencial equation for other hand tells how one or more fuctions, or variables, relate to their derivatives, i.e, their rate of chages.
